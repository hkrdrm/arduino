<h2>Ultra Sonic Blink</h2>
  <p>
    
    For this project we are going to make LED's blink in a 
    rythmic pattern using a delay.  This delay will be based 
    on a distance calculated using the input from our <a href="ultra_sonic_link">Ultra Sonic Sensor</a>.
    I'll be using a Shrimp board I built in my example; it functions just like an <a href="uno_link">Arduino Uno</a>.

  </p>

<h3>Items Needed</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Arduino Board</li>
    <li>4 X LED's Preferably Multi-Colored</li>
    <li>HC-SR04 - Ultrasonic Module</li>
    <li>Assorted Wires</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Optional Items</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Soldering Iron</li>
    <li>Paper Clip</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Circuit Setup</h3>
  <p>
    Pins 9 through 12 are going to be setup as output for the LED's.  Pin 8 will 
    be used to send a pulse throught the mic, and Pin 2 will catch the echo.  I 
    guess I should give a brief explanation on how the ultra sonic module works.  
    Basically when a sound wave hits and object it will bounce off that object, 
    and since we know what the speed of sound is we can use this to our advantage. 
    For our purposes we will be using the pace of sound with is

<h3>The Code</h3>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {                
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(11, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);
 
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
 
void loop() {
 
  long duration, distance;

  //Send Pulse through speaker
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);

  //Read Pulse from mic
  duration = pulseIn(2, HIGH);

  //Calculate Distance
  distance = (duration/2)/29.1;

  //Write distance to serial port you can uncomment this line to test your calculations
  //Serial.println( distance );

  //don't want to delay too long for great distances max it out at 200
  if(distance > 200){ 
    distance = 200;
  }

  //LED flashing sequence
  for(int j=9; j<=12; j++){
    digitalWrite(j, HIGH);
    delay(distance);
    digitalWrite(j, LOW);  
    delay(distance);
  }   

}
